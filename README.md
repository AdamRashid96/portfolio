CS Portfoio Project

In this assignment you will create a new web page to host the APCS projects you work on this year. As you finish a project
you will update your portfolio project page with references to the new work (to be done later). For this assignment, you will create 
a short bio about yourself (that you are comfortable being available public on the internet). This will be done using HTML markup.

# Goals
1. Introduce you to the git workflow.
2. Introduce you to some basic HTML.
3. Create a central location to show off the work you've done for APCS.

## Prerequisites
You will need an activated github account. (Should have already completed this step.)

## Steps

* You should have accepted the assignment at this point. Github will have already created the repository. The next step will be to clone the repository on your local machine.
